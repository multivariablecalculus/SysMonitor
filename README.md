# System Monitor or SysMonitor

A simple Cross-Platform CLI-based performance measurement tool. This is just a super lightweight version of Task Manager, or System Monitor and a completely independant program with only .NET framework 9.0.1 and programmed in C#. It also has graphical representation of CPU, GPU and RAM trend(s) and also shows the OS and hostname as a bonus.

Anyways, this program like mentioned above is completely indigenous and does not depend on any dlls for functioning, so you can just using 'dotnet run'. So, enjoy as per your needs!

Cheers, fellow coders!
