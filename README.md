# System Monitor or SysMonitor

A simple CLI-based performance measurement tool for Windows only. This is just a super lightweight version of Task Manager and completely independant program with only
.NET framework 9.0.1 and coded in C#. It also has graphical representation of CPU, GPU and RAM trend(s) and also shows the OS and hostname as a bonus.

Anyways, this program like mentioned above is completely indigenous and does not depend on any dlls for functioning, so you can just using 'dotnet run'. So, enjoy as per your needs!

Cheers, fellow coders!
